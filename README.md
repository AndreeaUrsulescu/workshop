In this session we'll learn the essentials about component communication in angular:

1.  @Input decorator
2.  @Output decorator

Tasks:

1.  Refactor places template to display each place using a component. The new component, called place will receive properties as input from parent component which is places
2.  Add edit functionality to place.name
3.  Add remove functionality to place
4.  Emit events from place to parent component and update array of places

Make sure to commit your changes using:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "Communication is key"
```

And then switch to the next branch, services:

```console
git checkout services
```
